For me:
  Learn how to plan and develop apps on my own
  Inspiration for other apps and to learn even more
  Portfolio
  Learn more about the style transfer neural net
  Interesting hobby, more useful than other stuff that I do
  Earn some money??? Secondary for sure

For users:
  Be able to make some "nice" art with no artistic ability by drawing. (think stick figures)
  App must be useable by kids and whomever else
  Finished artworks should be easy to share and store.
  Show adds at some point if it gets more than 1000 downloads?
  Can choose which style they want on their drawings

Specs:
  iOS only in first iteration
  Do processing on a backend somewhere
  No login or other complicating stuff
  Should be dead simple to use
  Start with only 5 styles

Future ideas:
  Consider adding photographies from camera or gallery in future. A kid can draw on paper, and then transfer the style using the app

Use cases:
  Start app
    - Start by seeing an example, find styles and examples that work well.
  Understand how to use the app easily
  Draw an image on the screen
    - As simple as possible, but must be possible to clear the window
  Render the drawing into fine art with a specific style
    -
  Chose a specific style
    - Tab bar or something on the bottom?
  Share or save the finished product
    - Regular iOS sharing impl
  See some kind of loading while waiting for rendering
    - Spinner with failure case

  Future:
